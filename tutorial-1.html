			<h2>WELCOME TO DREAMWORLD v0.9</h2>

			<p>The world of dreams is a series of infinities within infinities, comprised of the individual subconsciouses of every life form that exists within the boundaries of spacetime. Our minds are galaxies floating in the deathly still void of pure thought-space; each containing countless worlds, and each separated by unimaginably vast gulfs of emptiness. And yet, they are inextricably linked through an unseen network of celestial filaments. In this way, it is a reflection of our own universe: a macrocosm within the microcosm, which itself is just one step of a fractally repeating sequence—eternally alternating layers of the infinite and the infinitesimal.</p>
			<p>Anything you could possibly think of can be found here, as well as everything you couldn’t. Every story we have ever told ourselves, every work of art, every poem, every song—all of it is real, as real as you or me, and it exists intangibly in the world of dreams. However, many of the things that occupy this space are sadly fated to never be conceived of. These unactuated thought-forms wander this realm, fruitlessly searching for a way to matriculate into reality. They are hungry, and more desperate than you could ever know. This means that Dreamworld can sometimes be a very, very dangerous place. As such, there are a few things you should consider before embarking on your journey into this incorporeal plane...</p>
			<p><i>Launched in 2021 by Jeremy Myint, lostindream.world is a periodically updated, interactive art installation that draws heavily on aesthetic elements of web 2.0 and text adventure games of the 90s. Although it is intended as a companion and expansion of a programmatic musical universe, the participant is nevertheless encouraged to enjoy it for its artistic value in and of itself.</p>

			<p>The current version of lostindream.world does not have a mobile site. It is expected to be implemented with the release of v1.0. Until such time, this site is best viewed on a desktop, laptop, or tablet device. If you are on a mobile device, please turn your phone on its side and hope for the best. Headphones or speakers are recommended in any case.</i></p>
			<p>This place is very mysterious, so there may be hidden secrets just waiting to be found by those with a discerning eye. And remember, Dreamworld is beyond infinite—even this small fragment of it hasn't been completely explored. Be sure to come back every so often to discover new areas that appear!</p>
