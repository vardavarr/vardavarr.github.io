			<p><b>I will show you the dark. The true dark<br>
			The dark is not trite or contrived; neither is it lurid, nor ostentatious<br>
			The dark is subtle and deliberate. The dark is pervasive<br>
			It reaches out with a brumous tendril–gently caressing–and, like a siphon<br>
			Drains you until you are nothing but a husk<br></p>
			<p>I will show you the dark<br>
			I will teach you to fear again<br></p>
			<p>I will lead you to the place where the brutal monarch, Agony, reigns sovereign<br>
			Where the shadows blanket the land uniformly<br>
			Where darkness, like a writhing miasma<br>
			Permeates your lungs and seeps into your bones<br>
			Those hallowed halls, resounding with the sound of praise for Darkness,<br>
			The Most High,<br>
			Infinite and Everlasting,<br>
			For ever and ever (Amen)<br></p>
			<p>Surrounded by the weeping and the wailing and the gnashing of teeth,<br>
			You will curse the God who forsook you<br>
			You will curse yourself for squandering your brief moment in the sun<br>
			You will beg and plead for mercy<br>
			But by then, you will have moved beyond—<br>
			Into a realm where even Death himself cannot save you</b></p>
